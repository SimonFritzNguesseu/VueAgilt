<!--     At x we strive to build a future for mankind where the possibility to see
    life outside of earth is a reality. We’ve all been there as kids growing up,
    looking up in the sky towards the stars, wondering what might be out there.
    But it’s always been a fantasy rather than a reality. Words like alien life,
    space travels or planets have always been out of our reach. We want to
    change that and create the possibility for every human on earth to travel
    into outer space. Who wouldn’t want to see Mars? The moon? Or perhaps the
    dark and cold mysterious planet Neptune? Since the beginning of 2010 when
    our project first started by a team of five members, all from different
    backgrounds in different work areas, we have put our hearts and minds into
    this project. Today we’re a company of more than 500 members working day and
    night to continue to make this project evolve and last forever. Space is the
    next level for humankind, space is the undiscovered mystery that has always
    seemed to be out of mankind's reach. Will you be part of history and see the
    vast, dark but beautiful wonders of space? Or will you let it slip away? The
    choice is yours. When we first began this project we discussed the
    affordability for all people on earth. We wanted to make sure that everyone
    could afford these travels into space, and not only a select few. That is
    why we have developed our new technology named “Equilibrium” which in short,
    gives us endless amounts of energy to fuel our travels into space. That is
    why we offer affordable prices that fits everyone, all from smaller monthly
    payments, yearly or even our special VIP passes that give you access to
    travels further into space. Maybe you want to see the edge of the observable
    universe with your own eyes? Our VIP pass gives you access to this! It’s
    time for humanity to take the “next step” in evolving. Humankind has been
    stuck on planet earth far too long. We are ready to enter the final frontier
    of humanity. Question is, are you? Space.. The final frontier. -->
