          The moon, mankind's biggest triumph in terms of space traveling. The
          never ending question “Was the moon landing fake?” and “Did mankind
          ever set their foot on the moon?” which echoes in time still. Now you
          can find out by yourself! With our latest technology we triumphed over
          any lingering debates in the past. You can now go to the moon yourself
          and see it with your own eyes. Maybe you want to explore? Bring home a
          “moon rock”, yes you heard that right! A moon rock! Or maybe you want
          to take a drink in our new space moon bar called Lunarshack, try our
          latest space drink and enjoy some music with your friends!<br /><br />

          With a radius of 1,737.4 km and a surface area of 3.793x107 km2 you
          can explore to your heart's content! Our space shuttles offer five
          stopping points covering the whole moon, so that you may land wherever
          you like. The VIP pass even includes a premium ride into our new space
          station on the moon where we are developing the next phase in our
          company. Sign up now and don't miss out on next month's sale where you
          get five travels (back and forth) for the price of a normal ticket!<br /><br />
